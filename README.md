# Project - Pasty Problems

## Description

Pasty Problems is a helpful tool for knowing the Ultraviolet(UV) index for your particular location. You provide your location and skin type and pasty problems will let you know how long you have until you start to burn. Did you know that skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States? It is also one of the most preventable forms of the disease. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is the main cause of skin cancer, so one of the best ways to prevent skin cancer is to protect your skin from sun exposure with the use of sunscreen as well as being informed!
